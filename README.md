# Selene

My journey on learning how to build an interpreter (by writing a Lua interpreter).


Fun fact: The project name was chosen`Selene` because it is another name given to our moon (Lua, in portuguese), related to the Greek mythology goddess. Checkout [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selene). That's why the study of the moon's "geography" is called [selenography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenography).

Another fun fact is that I still doubt if I should name this project [Jaci](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaci), due to the moon goddess of [Guarani mythology](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitologia_guarani), a native Brazilian mythology (just like Lua is native from [Brasil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMlHex-Ca0A)).
